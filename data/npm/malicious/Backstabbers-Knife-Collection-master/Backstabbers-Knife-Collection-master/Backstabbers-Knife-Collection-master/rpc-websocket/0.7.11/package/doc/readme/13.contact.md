###Projects
I am available for commercial projects.

In commercial projects, I often do the initial prototyping by myself. After that, I manage external developer contributions through github and bitbucket. I usually end up being the long-term go-to person for how to evolve the system. My work involves reviewing Javascript for both the web and nodejs. I occasionally still do PHP. The startups I work for, are usually located elsewhere, but I do all of my work from Cambodia. If you are in need of a source code manager or quality assurance person for your project, feel free to contact me at erik@sankuru.biz.
