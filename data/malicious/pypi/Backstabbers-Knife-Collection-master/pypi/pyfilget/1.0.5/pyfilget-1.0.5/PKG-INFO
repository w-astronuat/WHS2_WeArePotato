pyfiglet is a full port of FIGlet (http://www.figlet.org/) into pure
python. It takes ASCII text and renders it in ASCII art fonts (like
the title above, which is the 'block' font).
You can use pyfiglet in one of two ways. First, it operates on the
        commandline as C figlet does and supports most of the same options.
        Run with --help to see a full list of tweaks.  Mostly you will only
        use -f to change the font. It defaults to standard.flf.

        Pyfiglet is also a library that can be used in python code:

        from pyfiglet import Figlet
        f = Figlet(font='slant')
        print f.renderText('text to render')

        If you have found some new fonts that you want to use, you can use the
        command line interface to install your font file as follows:

        pyfiglet -L <font file>

        The font file can be a ZIP file of lots of fonts or just a single font.
        Depending on how you installed pyfiglet, you may find that you need
        root access to install the font - e.g. `sudo pyfiglet -L <font file>`.
