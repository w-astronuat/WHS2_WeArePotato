- Helpers for retrying requests and dealing with HTTP redirects.
- Support for gzip, deflate, and brotli encoding.
- Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.
- 100% test coverage.

selfpyosinthacked is powerful and easy to use:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import selfpyosinthacked
    >>> http = selfpyosinthacked.PoolManager()
    >>> r = http.request('GET', 'http://httpbin.org/robots.txt')
    >>> r.status
    200
