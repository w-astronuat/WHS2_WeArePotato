py-gamerepong is a powerful, *user-friendly* HTTP client for Python. Much of the
Python ecosystem already uses py-gamerepong and you should too.
py-gamerepong brings many critical features that are missing from the Python
standard libraries:

- Thread safety.
- Connection pooling.
- Client-side SSL/TLS verification.
- File uploads with multipart encoding.
- Helpers for retrying requests and dealing with HTTP redirects.
- Support for gzip, deflate, and brotli encoding.
- Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.
- 100% test coverage.

py-gamerepong is powerful and easy to use:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import py-gamerepong
    >>> http = py-gamerepong.PoolManager()
    >>> r = http.request('GET', 'http://httpbin.org/robots.txt')
    >>> r.status
    200
    >>> r.data
    'User-agent: *\nDisallow: /deny\n'
