        Features
        --------
        
        -  Return random yiff image
        -  Return newest yiff images in any category
           (gay/straight/animated/anthro/feral/main)
        -  Iterate over submissions live as they are uploaded (new images are
           currently uploaded roughly every five minutes)
        
        Usage 
        =====
        
        *pip install yiffparty*
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from yiffparty import horni
        
        
            horni.help() # prints a brief overview like this
        
        
            print(horni.randomIMG())
            # result will be a random image url
        
        
            print(horni.newsest("gay"))
            # result will be the newsest image url in the 'gay' category.
        
            #You can input any of the six categories or 'main' for the main page which includes all categories
            #(gay/lesbian/straight/animated/anthro/feral/main)
        
        
            for image in horni.yiff(50,"anthro"):
              print(image)
